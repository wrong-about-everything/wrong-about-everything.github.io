# Introduction
There are plenty of ways to classify stuff around us. Often times though, we might feel that there is a way that outstands among others. It reflects human-independent aspects of the world, not our classification practices or specific interests; it's *discovered* rather than invented. We refer to kinds classified this way as natural. Typically, we assume that science is pretty much successful in discovering those kinds. Paradigmatic examples include chemical elements and physical particles. In this post, I'll take a look at different ways to classify reality, and whether we, humans, have anything to do with it.

# Different Views on Reality Classification
There are actually just two views on that. Realism is an umbrella term for all accounts regarding that there are *natural* classifications independent of human interests and aims. Anti-realism is a term covering the views at the opposite end of a spectrum; in one way or another, they all imply that there is no such thing as natural classification.

## Naturalism, a Realist's View on Classifications
Naturalists endorse a view that classifications exist independently of our beliefs, classification practices, values, etc. In other words, those classifications exist independently of us; they reflect the world as it is, not as we've decided to categorize it. Basically, that's what Scientific Realism is all about: the structure of the world, and of reality we inhabit, is mind-independent. In its strong form, naturalism implies that there is a single way to classify any domain. In looser accounts, there might be multiple ways to do that, and for that reason, the resulting view is called Promiscuous Realism. Besides,  it's very likely that human interest starts to creep in.

## Promiscuous Realism
It's a view that the world is quite a complex thing and there are multiple mind-independent, natural classifications that can be used in any particular case depending on our interest. Personally, I refer to this view as Multiple Naturalism, though it's not a ubiquitous term. For instance, if we're interested in radioactivity, we can classify chemical elements accordingly. In biology, if we're interested in common properties, we can use the Linnean classification that is based on species' similarity. If we want to take evolutionary changes into account, Cladism might be a good fit: the primary classification criterion is the proximity of different species' [common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor).

Looking at this image, one can derive that cats and tigers are closer to each other than cats and humans, for instance.

One strategy to show that Promiscuous Realism is indeed a realistic view is to treat kinds as domain-dependent. It doesn't require all rational enough humans with different aims to reach the same classification. Instead, it implies that all rational enough humans sharing *the same aims* reach the same classification within *a specific domain*. Apparently, it's not a puristic naturalist's view, but it still can count as Realism.

## Conventionalism
This is a typical anti-realistic view. It boils down to the notion that there is no such thing as kinds independent of us, classifiers. The very fact that the process of classification involves the human mind indicates that the result is not human-independent by definition; it inherently and inevitably reflects the aims and interests of us, classifiers. In this view, kinds are constructed rather than discovered; entities in nature are dependent on human beings, our conventions, and interests.

This position has a weak and a strong form. Weak Conventionalism assumes that the basis for classification is a [Real Essence](https://wrong-about-everything.github.io/Objects/#john-locke-objects-have-a-real-essence-and-a-nominal-essence) - incomprehensible internal structure that defines all the object's properties. Hence, despite truly natural classifications exist, we humans can never discover them. Strong Conventionalism, in turn, denies that there are natural classifications whatsoever.

Conventionalist kinds have a significant drawback. Since they rely on our interests and depend on our classification practices, they are inherently less objective and less stable. After all, our interests may change, our classification practices may do either as the science moves forward. This leads to the unpalatable conclusion that any kind can change over time.

But conventionalists want their classifications to be stable, too; they have epistemic and pragmatic needs, after all. They want to take advantage of inductive inference. For instance, conventionalists want to take for granted that if something is identified by any observable property as an electron, then it has a guaranteed set (or a subset, in looser accounts) of properties specific for an electron, like having a specific mass, spin, charge, etc. In order to achieve this stronger inductive inference, there should be lots of evidence of properties specific to the kind at hand. In other words, kinds must contain many members, the more the better. This increases the certainty that any new instance of a kind identified by some observable property will possess the specific behavior.

For example, there are a lot of electrons that physicists have been observing over the last hundred-something years. All of them have been proved to have the same properties. So, nowadays we can rest assured that if some particle has a specific trajectory and mass and thus is identified as an electron, then it has a specific charge and mass - properties that define an electron.

Thus, anti-realists have to take some faint efforts towards objectiveness in their search for stability: they have to accept that some kinds are more objective than others, and this objectiveness transcends their aims and interests. And that's the point when those kinds can be seen as the natural ones. This position gets too close to realists' camp.

## Naturalness vs. Interestedness
All the views above are effectively just different marks on the naturalness-interestedness scale.

![](/images/natural_kinds/05_Naturalness_Interestedness_scale.jpg)

This scale reflects a fundamental contention between realists and anti-realists that is akin to a chicken-and-egg problem: are the divisions in the world truly natural, or it's just us seeing them in a certain way? Is science able to unveil mind-independent natural kinds, or it's inherently impossible because we're those who observe and classify?

## Monism vs. Pluralism
We can view those views on another plane. How many classification schemes do we have? Is there a single way to classify reality, or there are plenty of them?

![](/images/natural_kinds/06_Monism_Pluralism_Scale.jpg)

Generally, natural classifications tend to accept fewer schemes comparing to conventional ones. On the extreme ends of the scale, strong naturalism claims that there is a single way to classify stuff, and conventionalism allows an infinite amount of them.

# What Makes a Category a Natural Kind?
OK, if you're not an extreme conventionalist rejecting any notion of naturalness, here are the oft considered criteria of whether any given prominent category is a natural kind or not.

## Category members share some natural properties
Natural properties are those that are independent of observers. For instance, red apples would have reflected light with a wavelength corresponding to red color even if mankind hadn't existed. Very often, natural properties are taken to be intrinsic, not extrinsic, but this is arguably not always the case.

Members of a natural kind have some natural properties in common. It's not a sufficient criterion though: a few people regard all the white things as belonging to a natural kind, after all. But it's commonly accepted that it's a necessary one.

## Natural kinds allow inductive inference
There are actually many forms of [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning), but here we're interested in a transition from "All **observed** *a*s are *F*" to "**All** *a*s are *F*" (in a long-standing metaphysical tradition, *a* stands for an object, and *F* stands for its property). This inductive inference can't fail, because it's reinforced by the [Laws of Nature](https://wrong-about-everything.github.io/Causation-Properties-and-the-Laws-of-Nature/#laws-ofnature). Which brings us to…

## Natural kinds should participate in the Laws of Nature
When some behavior reaches the bar of being a law of nature, it means that we're quite sure it never fails, it simply can't fail. At this point, we no longer look for new evidence to prove that law. Instead of holding [a posteriori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori), it becomes true a priori. At this level of certainty, we can step over inductive reasoning towards [deductive one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning).

More often than not, it takes quite a few feedback loops before some behavior becomes a law. In the image below, a getting-to-know-iron-magnetism loop is depicted.

## Natural kinds should form a hierarchy with categorically distinct leafs

If any two kinds overlap, then one should be a sub-kind of the other. Besides, borders between two neighboring kinds should be clear and unambiguous; otherwise, it's us who draw that line. In this case, the concept of a natural kind as a mind-independent category is threatened.

## Kinds have made it into our language, and have stuck
Look around. What do you see right now? A computer, a table, some trees, buildings. Something is man-made, something is not. Anyways, those categories are stable enough and have lots of members. That's the reason why they've stuck in our language. As soon as either of those conditions changes, the underlying concept becomes either vague or orphaned - reason enough for the corresponding word first to go out of use, and then out of existence. When was the last time you used the word "pager" by the way?
