# Introduction
There are plenty of ways to classify stuff around us. Often times though, we might feel that there is a way that outstands among others. It reflects human-independent aspects of the world, not our classification practices or specific interests; it's *discovered* rather than invented. We refer to kinds classified this way as natural. Typically, we assume that science is pretty much successful in discovering those kinds. Paradigmatic examples include chemical elements and physical particles. In this post, I'll take a look at different ways to classify reality, and whether we, humans, have anything to do with it.

# Different Views on Reality Classification
There are actually just two views on that. Realism is an umbrella term for all accounts regarding that there are *natural* classifications independent of human interests and aims. Anti-realism is a term covering the views at the opposite end of a spectrum; in one way or another, they all imply that there is no such thing as natural classification.

## Naturalism, a Realist's View on Classifications
Naturalists endorse a view that classifications exist independently of our beliefs, classification practices, values, etc. In other words, those classifications exist independently of us; they reflect the world as it is, not as we've decided to categorize it. Basically, that's what Scientific Realism is all about: the structure of the world, and of reality we inhabit, is mind-independent. In its strong form, naturalism implies that there is a single way to classify any domain. In looser accounts, there might be multiple ways to do that, and for that reason, the resulting view is called Promiscuous Realism. Besides,  it's very likely that human interest starts to creep in.

## Promiscuous Realism
It's a view that the world is quite a complex thing and there are multiple mind-independent, natural classifications that can be used in any particular case depending on our interest. Personally, I refer to this view as Multiple Naturalism, though it's not a ubiquitous term. For instance, if we're interested in radioactivity, we can classify chemical elements accordingly. In biology, if we're interested in common properties, we can use the Linnean classification that is based on species' similarity. If we want to take evolutionary changes into account, Cladism might be a good fit: the primary classification criterion is the proximity of different species' [common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor).

Looking at this image, one can derive that cats and tigers are closer to each other than cats and humans, for instance.

One strategy to show that Promiscuous Realism is indeed a realistic view is to treat kinds as domain-dependent. It doesn't require all rational enough humans with different aims to reach the same classification. Instead, it implies that all rational enough humans sharing *the same aims* reach the same classification within *a specific domain*. Apparently, it's not a puristic naturalist's view, but it still can count as Realism.

## Conventionalism
This is a typical anti-realistic view. It boils down to the notion that there is no such thing as kinds independent of us, classifiers. The very fact that the process of classification involves the human mind indicates that the result is not human-independent by definition; it inherently and inevitably reflects the aims and interests of us, classifiers. In this view, kinds are constructed rather than discovered; entities in nature are dependent on human beings, our conventions, and interests.

This position has a weak and a strong form. Weak Conventionalism assumes that the basis for classification is a [Real Essence](https://wrong-about-everything.github.io/Objects/#john-locke-objects-have-a-real-essence-and-a-nominal-essence) - incomprehensible internal structure that defines all the object's properties. Hence, despite truly natural classifications exist, we humans can never discover them. Strong Conventionalism, in turn, denies that there are natural classifications whatsoever.

Conventionalist kinds have a significant drawback. Since they rely on our interests and depend on our classification practices, they are inherently less objective and less stable. After all, our interests may change, our classification practices may do either as the science moves forward. This leads to the unpalatable conclusion that any kind can change over time.

But conventionalists want their classifications to be stable, too; they have epistemic and pragmatic needs, after all. They want to take advantage of inductive inference. For instance, conventionalists want to take for granted that if something is identified by any observable property as an electron, then it has a guaranteed set (or a subset, in looser accounts) of properties specific for an electron, like having a specific mass, spin, charge, etc. In order to achieve this stronger inductive inference, there should be lots of evidence of properties specific to the kind at hand. In other words, kinds must contain many members, the more the better. This increases the certainty that any new instance of a kind identified by some observable property will possess the specific behavior.
